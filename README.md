# Project-File-Organizer


These scripts organize files by categorizing them into directories based on their file extensions (e.g., txt, pdf, docx, png) within the current working directory. They iterate through the files in the directory, create respective subdirectories if they don't exist, and move files into the corresponding directories based on their file extensions.
